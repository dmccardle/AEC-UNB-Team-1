Using wind data and ocean depth to intelligently position offshore wind turbines.
The goal of this system is to provide the user with the best possible combination 
of offshore wind turbine locations. A statistical model determines the 'best candidate'
locations for turbine placement, and determines how many of these locations can be used
within a given budget.

### User Guide
From the home page, the user may update any of the parameters of the cost-data sheet from
the excel document provided. Once done, the user simply clicks "calculate" and the system
determines the best arrangement of wind turbines. If the user wishes to export their modified
cost data, they can click export and download the new file.
